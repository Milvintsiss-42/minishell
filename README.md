# minishell

This repo contain my minishell project that I did at 42 school with [oaarsse](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/oaarsse), if you are currently doing your 42 cursus please know that this repo is not a cheatsheet
and copying my work is completly unproductive. If you have difficulties doing an exercise, ask one of your seatmates. Copying someone else work will
never help you to improve your skills.

If you finished your minishell project and want to know about other possible resolutions of this exercise, you are at the right place.
